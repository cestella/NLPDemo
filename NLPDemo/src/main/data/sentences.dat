No hydronephrosis nor hydroureter seen. No perinephric collections identified. The patient had catheterized herself immediately prior to the study, and therefore the bladder is empty. Impression: Normal appearing kidneys. The slight change in renal size may be due to technical variation in obtaining measurements. 
596.54IMPRESSIONThe kidneys now appear normal. The patient is postoperative bladder augmentation and the expected findings of debris and irregularity of the wall are apparent.

786.07IMPRESSIONPeribronchial thickening and mild hyperinflation suggest a viral etiology. No definite consolidations are identified.
786.07IMPRESSIONPeribronchial thickening consistent with viral disease or asthmatic bronchitis. Minimal retraction or pectus excavatum. No air trapping.
786.07IMPRESSIONPeribronchial thickening or patchy infiltrate consistent with asthmatic bronchitis may well be present.

786.2IMPRESSION1. Borderline hyperinflation. 2. No focal pneumonia.
786.2IMPRESSION1. Chest radiograph within normal limits. 2. No acute abnormalities.
786.2IMPRESSION1. Clear chest. 2. Air - fluid level in the right maxillary antrum with some opacification of the ethmoid air cells and frontal sinuses. Findings consistent with acute sinusitis.
786.2IMPRESSION1. Clear lungs. 2. Mild thoracic curvature, possibly positional. Clinical correlation is needed.
786.2IMPRESSION1. Coarse central lung markings which may represent reactive airways or viral small airways disease. 2. Small focal opacity in right lower lobe, which may represent a small focus of pneumonia or atelectasis.
786.2IMPRESSION1. Hyperinflation. 2. Right basilar plate - like atelectasis.
786.2IMPRESSION1. Increased markings with hyperinflation suggests viral illness or reactive airway disease. 2. Moderate bowel gas distention left upper quadrant. Unusual visualization of the inner and outer wall of a bowel loop in the left upper quadrant. The patient was upright on the chest x-ray and there is no evidence for free air on the upright film. This finding may then be best explained by the administration of contrast or coating of the bowel wall by an ingested substance. Findings should be correlated clinically. If there are abdominal symptoms a followup abdomen film could be considered. Findings conveyed to the referring clinician's office at time of interpretation.
786.2IMPRESSION1. Indistinctness of the right cardiac border raising the possibility of minimal atelectasis of the right middle lobe.
786.2IMPRESSION1. Left basilar atelectasis or pneumonia. 2. Very dense nodule right lateral inferior thorax. This could represent a calcified granuloma, but is nonspecific; or it is outside the thorax and in the region of the skin or subcutaneous tissues.
786.2IMPRESSION1. Left lower lobe infiltrate, likely representing pneumonia. 
786.2IMPRESSION1. Left upper lobe air space opacity. With history of cough and fever this would be most consistent with pneumonia.
786.2IMPRESSION1. Mild hyperinflation. 2. No focal pneumonia.
786.2IMPRESSION1. Mild patchy lingular air space disease. Atelectasis versus pneumonia. 2. Prominent appearing left pulmonary artery should be correlated with the presence or absence of heart murmur.
786.2IMPRESSION1. Mild peribronchial thickening suggestive of reactive airway disease versus viral infection. 2. No focal infiltrates to indicate pneumonia.
786.2IMPRESSION1. Mildly coarse central lung markings with minimally increased lung markings at the left posterior lung base, consistent with atelectasis or early pneumonia. 2. Mild convex right curvature of the mid thoracic spine.
786.2IMPRESSION1. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
786.2IMPRESSION1. No acute disease. 2. Possible pectus excavatum.
786.2IMPRESSION1. No evidence of pneumonia. Normal chest x-ray.
786.2IMPRESSION1. No focal consolidation. 2. Minimal peribronchial thickening.
786.2IMPRESSION1. No focal pneumonia. 2. Viral changes.
786.2IMPRESSION1. No focal pneumonia. Likely chronic changes at the left lung base. 2. Mild anterior wedging of the thoracic vertebral bodies.
786.2IMPRESSION1. No focal pulmonary consolidation. 2. Gas - filled distended loops of bowel as described above.
786.2IMPRESSION1. No focal pulmonary opacity is identified. 2. Focal angulation of the trachea at the thoracic inlet with questionable soft tissue attenuation overlying the sternum. Recommend repeat study and clinical correlation. The findings were discussed by phone with the referring clinician the day of the exam.
786.2IMPRESSION1. No new focal pneumonia. 2. Interval resolution of previously described left lower lobe opacity.
786.2IMPRESSION1. No pneumonia. 2. Incidental note made of mild compression deformity of a mid to lower thoracic spine vertebral body.
786.2IMPRESSION1. No pneumonia. Resolution of previously seen peribronchial cuffing. 2. Mild convex right curve of the thoracic spine, which may be positional. Recommend clinical correlation.
786.2IMPRESSION1. Normal chest x-ray.
786.2IMPRESSION1. Persistent peribronchial thickening, consistent with viral illness. 2. No focal airspace disease.
786.2IMPRESSION1. Prominence of palatine and lingual tonsils as described above. 2. No findings to suggest croup.
786.2IMPRESSION1. Right lower lobe opacity may represent atelectasis or pneumonia.
786.2IMPRESSION1. Right middle lobe atelectasis vs pneumonia. 2. Interval resolution of right lower lobe opacity.
786.2IMPRESSION1. Suggestion of a small pleural effusion on the frontal projection which is not well seen on the lateral view. No consolidative infiltrates are seen.
786.2IMPRESSIONA triangular density is identified just posterior to the heart on the lateral film. This creates more of a vague opacity on the frontal exam in the region of the lingula. Findings suggest volume loss in the lingula, with or without superimposed infection. There is no associated pleural effusion. The perihilar markings are within normal limits. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouette is normal. No bony abnormalities are seen.
786.2IMPRESSIONAcute viral illness vs reactive airway disease with no pneumonia.
786.2IMPRESSIONAir space disease at the right base which likely represents pneumonia.
786.2IMPRESSIONAirspace opacity previously noted in the right lung base has resolved. The lungs are currently well expanded and clear. There is no focal infiltrate or pleural effusion. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouette is normal. The airway is also normal on both frontal and lateral films.
786.2IMPRESSIONAirway process such as viral infection or reactive airways disease with superimposed more focal opacity in the left lower lobe which may be an early pneumonia or atelectasis.
786.2IMPRESSIONBibasilar opacities and right upper lobe opacity. These could represent either atelectasis or pneumonia but given the bilaterality and the age mycoplasma as well as other atypical pneumonia should be included in the differential diagnosis.
786.2IMPRESSIONBilateral hilar opacities which may represent a viral or small airways disease. No focal pneumonia is identified.
786.2IMPRESSIONCervical spine within normal limits. The leftward convex curvature is likely positional, but clinical correlation is needed. 
786.2IMPRESSIONChest clear and heart normal.
786.2IMPRESSIONChest now clear and heart normal.
